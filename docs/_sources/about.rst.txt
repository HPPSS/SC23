About HPPSS
+++++++++++

Python is the lingua franca of scientific discovery workflows. As the second most popular language
with an estimated 15 million world-wide developers in 2022, Python bridges the worlds of artificial
intelligence, data science, high-performance computing applications and web-application development.

In addition, modern and emerging science workflows make use of shell scripts, databases, HPC simulation
codes, AI frameworks, and data manipulation scripts, stitched together and often highly customized to
the configuration of a particular system. Python, with the support of its massive user community, includes
the standard interfaces necessary to unify these disparate things into a common interface for scientists.
A single programmable interface for edge-to-HPC that makes it possible to compose high-performance and scalable
workflows of distributed applications across languages would be a foundation for the post Exascale era.

HPPSS aims to bring together the Python user community attempting to scale code for HPC, AI and Data for science:

* Expose new developments in Python for HPC, AI, and Data at Scale to SC attendees
* Discuss advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and barriers for Python in scientific computing
* Identify improvements required for Python runtimes on future supercomputing architectures
* Survey tools/projects in the Python ecosystem for science
* Discuss programming models for HPC, cloud-native, and hybrid-native workflows using Python
* Bring together industry, academia, and national labs to identify requirements for distributed and parallel computing
