Call for Demos!
+++++++++++++++

HPPSS is accepting submissions that demonstrate the application of a technology for greatly enhancing the performance
and capability of Python at scale. Technologies that are applicabale to a wide range of use-cases and accessible
to a broad user base are of particular interest. Showing technologies applied to specific use-cases can be very
helpful for the audience's understanding, but be sure to show and discuss how they generalize.


Important Dates
===============

* Submission opens: June 1, 2023
* Paper Submission deadline: August 8, 2023
* Decisions: September 8, 2023
* Camera ready due: September 29, 2023
* SC23 conference: November 12-17th
* HPPSS half-day workshop: morning of November 12th


Interest Areas
==============

Submissions in the following areas are well-suited for HPPSS:

* Python for accelerated computing at scale
* Programming of federated/distributed workflows
* Data management between Python libraries, processes and with storage
* Performance via intelligent data management across memory hierarchies
* High-bandwidth/low-latency network performance for Python
* Multi-processing for on-node and off-node configurations
* Program execution including parallelization and asynchronous communication


Submission Format
=================

Submissions can be made in either the Demo or Work-in-progress tracks. Both tracks will feature work that is innovative
and of significant interest to the community.

Demos
-----

The Demo track is for more mature work and should be based on examples/code that is accessible to anyone in the
audience. These submissions include a 4-page paper, demo recording, and presentation designed around the demo.

Work-in-progress
----------------

The Work-in-progress track is for work that may not be ready for community adoption but demonstrates the direction
and would benefit from community feedback. These submissions include an abstract and demo recording.

Demo Video Submission
---------------------

Video recordings of demos should be submitted through Zenodo. Recordings should include audio commentary describing
the demo and what is being shown. Submissions accepted to the conference will have an opportunity to produce an
updated video that does not include commentary. The presenter should be prepared to describe the demo video as part
of their presentation.

TODO: How should they indicate the URL with the Linkling submission? How to upload to Zenodo.
